The algorithm considers time series segmentation problem as Gath--Geva clustering with the minimum message length criterion as segmentation order selection criterion. One characteristic of the improved Gath--Geva clustering algorithm is its unsupervised nature which can automatically determine the optimal segmentation order. Another characteristic is the application of the modified component-wise expectation maximization algorithm in Gath--Geva clustering which can avoid the drawbacks of the classical expectation maximization algorithm: the sensitivity to initialization and the need to avoid the boundary of the parameter space. The other characteristic is the improvement of numerical stability by integrating segmentation order selection into model parameter estimation procedure. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally tested on artificial and hydrometeorological time series. The obtained experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

The definition and recursive formulation of segment errors of univariate time series are extended to multivariate time series, so that DP algorithm is computationally viable for multivariate time series. The order of autoregression and segmentation are simultaneously determined by Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion. The segmentation procedure is evaluated with artificially synthesized and hydrometeorological multivariate time series. Synthetic multivariate time series are generated by threshold autoregressive model, and in real-world multivariate time series experiment we propose that besides the regression by constant, autoregression should be taken into account. The experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well.},

The clustering algorithm involves a new objective function, which incorporates an extra variable related to segmentation, while dynamic time warping (DTW) is applied to determine distances between non-equal-length series. As optimizing the introduced objective function is a challenging task, we put forward an effective approach using dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. When calculating the DTW distance, a DP-based method is developed to reduce the computational complexity. In a series of experiments, both synthetic and real-world time series are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate higher effectiveness and advantages of the constructed algorithm when compared with the existing segmentation approaches.},
