SJSUthesis is a LaTeX class created by David C. Anastasiu for masters thesis authors 
from the College of Engineering at San Jose State University. It follows the 
current Graduate and Undergraduate Programs (GUP) thesis guidelines, currently found at
http://www.sjsu.edu/gup/gradstudies/thesis/index.html and attempts to simplify the
formatting of theses for students. Students should, however, read the current GUP
requirements carefully and rectify any style discrepancies before submitting their
thesis. Additionally, note that GUP is very strict on grammar and spelling mistakes.

The style if offered free of charge and the author does not guarantee it is
free from error. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
the template and style are distributed on an ”AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

The thesis style is based on the IEEE compsoc style, which is included in the 
distribution. GUP will require evidence of that style be submitted along with the thesis.
I have included a sample IEEE compsoc document under the evidence directory.

Corrections and improvements to the style are welcome. Send me a pull request.

IEEEtran is a LaTeX class for authors of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) transactions journals and conferences.
The latest version of the IEEEtran package can be found at CTAN:

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ieeetran

as well as within IEEE's site:

http://www.ieee.org/

For latest news, helpful tips, answers to frequently asked questions,
beta releases and other support, visit the IEEEtran home page at my

Version 1.8b has a number of significant changes over the v1.8a release.
For a full history of changes, please read the file changelog.txt.
The most notable changes in this release include:

 1) Added new comsoc mode for the IEEE Communications Society.
    This mode (at present) only invokes the use of the newtxmath math fonts.
 
 2) Revised IEEEeqnarray column specifications to work with active " 
    (or other punctuation catcode changes) as with babel under the
    german or ngerman language modes. 
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser for reporting this problem.

 3) Added \indexspace and other index related macros as newer versions of
    article.cls now do. These macros are needed to avoid an error when
    using the glossaries package.
    Thanks to Sebastian Nyberg for suggesting this change.

 4) Fixed odd/even page header font bug under compsoc mode and
    other page style code improvements.
    Thanks to Marco Paolieri for reporting this problem.

 5) Added hooks to allow for easy control of spacing above title.

 6) Added the \IEEEnoauxwrite command.
    Thanks to Sudarshan Mukherjee for suggesting this feature.


NOTE: Take care not to confuse the "comsoc" and "compsoc" class
options/modes as they are very different:

comsoc  ==> IEEE Communications Society
compsoc ==> IEEE Computer Society

The comsoc mode requires that an acceptable Times math font be available on
the LaTeX system. This requirement will be enforced by IEEEtran in comsoc
mode. Either the freely available newtxmath font by Michael Sharpe
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
(version 1.451, July 28, 2015 or later is recommended)
or the commercial MathTime font (e.g., mtpro2.sty) is acceptable.
See Section II-D (2.4) "Class Options - comsoc, compsoc, transmag" of
the IEEEtran HOWTO for more details.


Best wishes for all your publication endeavors,
